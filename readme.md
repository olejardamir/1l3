## About logo
This is most likely going to be rebranded. For now, the logo represents the Bitcoin's logo, and a segragated letter B. It contains the graphical components that look like 1, L, 3 and therefore it is the symbol of a token.
Since we are taking the Bitcoin's logic apart and combining it into a new functioning whole, it represents the token's backend and the overall structure. The colours are chosen as the vector pointing a direction in a light spectrum, making this token appear in front of the BTC logo's dominating colours (no further explanation will be given). The background is #3a004c and the letters are #feff7f. The shape of the logo and a coin is rectangular, and letters are rectangular as well. The closest font is called "Spec" and it resembles the old Sinclair ZX spectrum logo.

## About name NoBTC
Because we are solving multiple problems associated with the BTC, the common naming convention in programming such as SQL vs NoSQL has been applied. Therefore, it has nothing to do with a negation of a BTC model. Instead, it means that the major components associated with the BTC are either not necessary or solved within a contract without a third-party solution. The token is stand-alone and (except the launch) nothing is controlled by the owner.

## Network and specs
It is an ERC20 token on Ethereum network

## Problems that are being solved
- There is no contract owner.
- There is no hardware required for mining and it can be done with any device.
- Mining is done by (at least two) interactions with a contract.
- There is no need for the mining pools since the contract is a mining pool.
- The halvening directly implies the minimum price increase by (times) two.
- The greedy behaviour is controlled by assigning the contract-interaction prices (in Gwei).
- There is no initial advantage for early adopters (including the contract owners).
- The ICO, IPO, or similar is solved by the contract and there is no middle-man.
- The presale is done by having as many miners as possible interacting with a contract prior to a launch.
- There are no premined tokens or initial token allocations. Everyone has equal chances to earn.
- Advanced tracking and statistics.
- The only power the token owner has is launching the token once enough miners are established in a pool.
- The usability will be solved with a separate project meant to promote the token and increase the value.
- Users can register their addresses by adding data to inner maps and fields so we know who they are (when if necessary)

## NOTE
The token is currently under a development, and the source code will not be shared before the launch, except the testing.
